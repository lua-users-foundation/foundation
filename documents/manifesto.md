# The Lua Users Foundation Manifesto

### This document is still a draft and a work in progress

The Lua Users Foundation (the Foundation) is an association of individuals in a
modular umbrella structure consisting of several workgroups, detailed in the Lua
Users Foundation Constitution.
The Foundation's formal decision-making process is governed by the Lua Users
Foundation Constitution, according to the Foundation Goals and Values, towards
our Mission.

## The Mission

  * Support and promote the Lua programming language, its community and
  ecosystems.

## The Values

  * The Lua programming language is developed by the Lua Team and defined by the
   Lua Programming Manual. Furthermore:
  * The Lua programming language is small, fast, easy to learn and use.
  * The Lua programming language philosophy is:  "Mechanisms instead of
  policies".
  * The Lua Users Foundation values simplicity and accessibility (easy to learn
    and use) in our work.
  * The Lua ecosystem is diverse: it includes many libraries, frameworks,
  implementations, dialects and related languages.
  * The Lua community is inclusive. We welcome and encourage participation by
  everyone. We are committed to foster a diverse community with respect of
  personal characteristics such as, but not limited to, gender identity or
  expression, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, religion, disability, class,
  geographic location, background and experience.
  * Lua and related technologies should have wider adoption in the world.
  * The Lua Users Foundation is a transparent and not for profit endeavour.

## The Goals

 * Aid the Lua Team and the Lua programming language implementers.
 * Support and foster critical projects such as Lua libraries (modules) and
 framework ecosystems.
 * Support and foster the Lua community.
 * Encourage wider adoption of Lua programming language in the world.
 * Be a lasting organization generating positive impact on those writing
 software in Lua.
 * Serve as a point of contact for organizations seeking to support and
 sponsor Lua development.
